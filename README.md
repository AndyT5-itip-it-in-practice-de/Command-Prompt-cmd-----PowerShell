Windows PowerShell vs Command Prompt 
---------------------------------------------

What is the Windows Command Prompt?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows Command Prompt (also known as the command line, 
cmd.exe or simply cmd) is a command shell based on the MS-DOS 
operating system from the 1980s that enables a user to interact 
directly with the operating system. Specifically, this venerable
command shell provides an environment to run applications and
various utilities; output is displayed in the same window. 
It is possible to use the cmd shell to create and edit scripts 
and save them to batch files to solve automation tasks in one-system 
frames; however, it was never intended for remote system administration.


What is Windows PowerShell?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows PowerShell is a command shell and scripting language designed 
for system administration tasks.  It was built on top of the .NET framework, 
which is a platform for software programming developed by Microsoft in 2002.
PowerShell commands, or cmdlets, help you manage your Windows infrastructure. 
In addition, they enable a user to access the registry, the file system and
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) space on systems remotely. Moreover, 
the PowerShell command shell enables you to create complex scripts 
with multiple conditions.
